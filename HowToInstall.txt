HOW TO INSTALL
---
1. Go to config.php and enter the details of your MySQL server, also change the $website_url value to you
website URL.
2. Go to install.php and if you do not get an error(in which case config.php isn't configured right) delete the file.
3. If for some weird reason install.php did not work for you, go to sql.sql and copy that to your phpmyadmin.
